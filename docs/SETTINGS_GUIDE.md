# NTE Auto-Fish Settings Guide

This guide details the meaning and adjustment methods for each setting in NTE Auto-Fish, helping you optimize the auto-fishing bot's performance according to your game environment and needs.

All settings can be adjusted in real-time in the **Settings** tab on the left side of the GUI. Remember to click `Save Settings` at the bottom to save your changes.

## 1. PID Tuning
The PID controller is used to smoothly and accurately track the target safe zone in the fishing mini-game. If the cursor is jittering severely or failing to keep up, adjust these parameters:

*   **Kp (Proportional Gain):** The base response strength. **A higher value means a stronger force moving the cursor toward the target**. If the cursor lags behind a fast-moving safe zone, increase Kp. If the cursor shakes violently back and forth around the target, Kp is too high, please lower it.
*   **Ki (Integral Gain):** Used to eliminate long-term steady-state errors. Usually kept small (e.g., 0.05). If the cursor is consistently slightly off the center, slightly increase Ki.
*   **Kd (Derivative Gain):** Used to suppress oscillation, acting as a damper. If the cursor always overshoots and swings back and forth, increase Kd.
*   **Deadband (px):** When the distance between the cursor and the center of the safe zone is within this range, the bot will not send any key presses. **This effectively prevents nervous jittering caused by over-correction near the center.** Recommended value is around 5.0.
*   **Integral limit:** Prevents the integral term from accumulating too much and causing windup. The default 150 is usually fine.
*   **Adaptive damping:** Highly recommended to be **Enabled**. When severe cursor oscillation is detected, the system will automatically reduce the Kp temporarily to quickly stabilize the cursor.

## 2. Vision & Detection
This section controls how the bot identifies game elements via screen colors. You may need to tweak these when facing lighting changes (e.g., sunset/night).

*   **Safe Zone HSV:** The color range of the target safe zone on the fishing bar.
*   **Cursor HSV:** The color range of the player's cursor on the fishing bar.
*   **Bite Trigger HSV:** The color range of the float/exclamation mark used to detect if a fish bites.
    *   *Tuning Tip: Expand the HSV options, adjust the Min/Max sliders, and observe the preview swatch to match the actual in-game color as closely as possible.*
*   **Edge ignore ratio:** The ratio of the left and right edges of the fishing bar to ignore (e.g., 0.02 means ignoring the outer 2% on both sides). This prevents misidentifying the bar's borders as the cursor or safe zone.
*   **Blue pixel trigger:** The minimum number of matched pixels in the detection region required to trigger a "fish bite". If the bot pulls too early (false positive), increase this value; if it misses bites, lower it.

## 3. Timing
Defines various delays and timeouts for the bot's state machine, ensuring smooth logic and preventing softlocks.

*   **Cast animation (s):** How long to wait after casting before starting bite detection. Detecting too early might cause false triggers.
*   **Bite timeout (s):** Max time to wait for a bite before automatically recasting.
*   **Lost frame limit:** During the struggle phase, if the cursor or safe zone is lost for this many consecutive frames, the struggle is considered over (fish caught or escaped).
*   **Result wait (s):** How long to wait before closing the result screen after catching a fish. Increase if the game doesn't register the close action in time.
*   **Waiting poll (s):** How often to check the screen while waiting for a bite.
*   **Tracking poll (s):** The update interval for PID and vision tracking during the struggle. Lower is more responsive but uses more CPU.
*   **Bait error limit:** How many consecutive cast errors before popping up an error dialog (usually due to running out of bait). Reaching this limit stops the bot to prevent an infinite loop.
*   **Max struggle (s):** The maximum allowed time for a single struggle phase (default 120s). Prevents softlocks if a bug occurs.

## 4. Input & Hotkeys
Manages in-game key bindings and the bot's global hotkeys.

*   **Key Bindings:**
    *   **Cast key:** Key to cast/hook (Default: F)
    *   **Move left/right:** Keys to pull the fish during the struggle (Default: A and D)
    *   **Exit key:** Key to close UI screens (Default: Esc)
*   **Result close:** How to close the result popup. Options: "Click center" or "Press exit key".
*   **Always on top:** Keeps the GUI window on top of the game window.
*   **Debug logging:** Writes detailed PID tracking data to `fishing_data.csv`. Only recommended for troubleshooting.
*   **Monitor:** If you have multiple monitors, select the one running the game to ensure the capture region is correct.
*   **Global Hotkeys:**
    *   **Toggle:** Hotkey to pause/resume the bot (Default: F8). Recommend using this before navigating game menus.
    *   **Stop:** Hotkey to completely stop the bot (Default: F12).

## 5. Humanization
Introduces randomness and imperfect reactions to make the bot look more like a human player, reducing the risk of anti-cheat detection.

*   **Humanize input:** Master switch. Strongly recommended to leave on.
*   **Key Pulse Timing:**
    *   **Pulse hold min/max:** Random duration range for holding a key during the struggle.
    *   **Pulse gap min/max:** Random delay range between key presses.
*   **Deadband Micro-corrections:**
    *   **Deadband taps:** When the cursor is in the deadband (perfectly aligned), occasionally send very short "micro-tap" inputs to mimic human hand jitter and subconscious adjustments.
    *   **Tap chance:** Probability of triggering a deadband tap per loop.
*   **Reaction Latency:**
    *   **Reaction min/max:** Simulates human visual reaction time. The bot waits this long before pressing a key after seeing a movement.
    *   **Reaction dist:** The distribution pattern of random delays (uniform, gaussian, exponential).
*   **PID Noise:** 
    *   Overlays random noise onto the perfect PID output, making the movement path less mechanical.
*   **Timing Jitter:** 
    *   Adds random fluctuation to fixed timings like cast animation and result wait.
*   **Adaptive Focus:**
    *   Simulates real player behavior: When the fish is far away and about to escape, a player's focus increases and reactions become faster. When enabled, larger errors automatically reduce the bot's latency and increase input frequency to pull the fish back quickly.

## 6. System & Updates

*   **Check for Updates:** Checks GitHub for new releases. If found, a "Download Update" button appears to open the release page in your browser.

**Troubleshooting:**
1. If the cursor always lags behind: Check if `Kp` under `PID Tuning` is too low, or if `Reaction Latency` under `Humanization` is too high.
2. If the bot stops hooking fish during sunset/night: Warm in-game lighting reduces blue pixels. Slightly lower the `Blue pixel trigger` in `Vision & Detection`, or recalibrate the `Safe Zone` and `Cursor` HSV ranges.
3. If the detection area needs adjustment: Trigger `recalibrate` from the console or the main GUI window.
